A **new way** to manage your private repository 

#### What is Ltk
Ltk is a simple package manager written in nodejs to manage your private repository on your server


#### How Ltk works
Ltk need a ltk server to host the information about your private packages

##### Structure of information

Informations are saved as json like this
```
"name": "ltk-test",
      "url": "git@github.com:ltkpm/ltk-test.git",
      "type": "node",
      "version": 1,
      "hash": "6ca47b2cb4d6a1886a6d2ca7d0cf1843450aff12478b7e8d9e10cbed18a81454d8c486c6aff6830428a16bfcd569628d9727924a03d5de8f2a8c632b87830e74"
```
